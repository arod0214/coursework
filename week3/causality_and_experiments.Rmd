IST Question 12.1:

  Consider a medical condition that does not have a standard treatment. The recommended design of a clinical trial for a new treatment to such condition involves using a placebo treatment as a control. A placebo treatment is a treatment that externally looks identical to the actual treatment but, in reality, it does not have the active ingredients. The reason for using placebo for control is the "placebo effect". Patients tend to react to the fact that they are being treated regardless of the actual beneficial effect of the treatment.

  As an example, consider the trial for testing magnets as a treatment for pain that was described in Question 9.1. The patients that where randomly assigned to the control (the last 21 observations in the file "magnets.csv") were treated with devises that looked like magnets but actually were not. 

  The goal in this exercise is to test for the presence of a placebo effect in the case study "Magnets and Pain Relief" of Question 9.1 using the data in the file "magnets.csv".

1. Let X be the measurement of change, the difference between the score of pain before the treatment and the score after the treatment, for patients that were treated with the inactive placebo. Express, in terms of the expected value of X, the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis for a statistical test to determine the presence of a placebo effect. The null hypothesis should reflect the situation that the placebo effect is absent.

  Null: The expected value of X will be 0.

  Alternate: The expected value of X != 0.

2. Identify the observations that can be used in order to test the hypotheses.
  The "changed" column for the patients who received the placebo. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
magnets <- read.csv("../week3/magnets.csv")
placebo <- magnets$change[30:50]

# 3. Carry out the test and report your conclusion. (Use a significance level of 5%.)
t.test(placebo)
# Since p < 0.05 (0.004702), we know that the placebo effect is not absent. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.
```

IST Question 13.1:

  In this exercise we would like to analyze the results of the trial that involves magnets as a treatment for pain. The trial is described in Question 9.1. The results of the trial are provided in the file "magnets.csv".
Patients in this trail where randomly assigned to a treatment or to a control. The responses relevant for this analysis are either the variable "change", which measures the difference in the score of pain reported by the patients before and after the treatment, or the variable "score1", which measures the score of pain before a device is applied. The explanatory variable is the factor "active". This factor has two levels, level "1" to indicate the application of an active magnet and level "2" to indicate the application of an inactive placebo. In the following questions you are required to carry out tests of hypotheses.

```{r}
#  All tests should conducted at the 5% significance level:
# 1. Is there a significance difference between the treatment and the control groups in the expectation of the reported score of pain before the application of the device?
t.test(magnets$score1 ~ magnets$active)

# No. Since p > 0.05, this tells us that our groups do not look different before application of the device. Makes sense due to random assignment into groups. 
```

```{r}
# 2. Is there a significance difference between the treatment and the control groups in the variance of the reported score of pain before the application of the device?
var.test(magnets$score1 ~ magnets$active)
# No. Same reasoning as problem 13.1.1
```

```{r}
# 3. Is there a significance difference between the treatment and the control groups in the expectation of the change in score that resulted from the application of the device?
t.test(magnets$change ~ magnets$active)
# Yes. Since p < 0.05, magnets do have an effect on the expectation of the response.
```

```{r}
# 4. Is there a significance difference between the treatment and the control groups in the variance of the change in score that resulted from the application of the device?
var.test(magnets$change ~ magnets$active)
# Yes. Since p < 0.05, magnets also affect the variance of the response.
```

```{r}
# Make a plot of the distribution of outcomes (score1) split by the treatment (active)
magnets %>% ggplot(aes(fill = active)) + geom_histogram(position = "dodge", alpha = 0.5, aes(change))
```

```{r}
# Estimate the effect size by calculating Cohen's d. Think about whether the effect seems practically meaningful.
library(effsize)
cohen.d(formula = change ~ as.factor(active), data = magnets)

std <- sd(magnets$change)
magnets %>% group_by(active) %>% summarise(count = n(), avg = mean(change)) %>% summarise(cohen_d = (first(avg)-last(avg))/std)

```
